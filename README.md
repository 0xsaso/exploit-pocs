# exploit-pocs
## Small collection of exploit POCs from practice challenges.

When I started studying for the OSCP, I gathered all the practice challenges I could get my
hands on to prepare for being able to write buffer overflow exploits, so here
they are.

I'll keep adding as I go for more complicated exploits as I learn the
techniques associated with them.
